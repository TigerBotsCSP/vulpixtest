Vulpix testing repository (branches are not in my vocab bro)
<br>
<br>
This repository has ShuffleBoard support for most swerve variables so it's easier to debug different variables for PIDs and feedbacks. Swerve has a lot of them, so this makes it a lot easier to get swerve smooth.
<br>
<br>
There's also NyaDS 1.1. It's just the original NyaDS but support for saving pathways to the local computer. When you click save, it saves the created pathway both to the local computer and roboRIO. Also, there's basic logging/notifications. Only autoCreate.html was edited for version 1.1.
<br>
<br>
NyaDS 1.1 still needs support for voltages and swerve driving in the execution code. After we test swerve and get an arm on the robot, assuming we'll use this robot for the next offseason event (that's why we have nyatest to be safe), we'll support those two missing things.
